Asma is meticulous in her teaching and she is always well prepared for her lessons. She explains the concepts clearly in a way that is easy to follow and understand. Additional practice questions and guidance is always provided upon request and she has supported my daughter towards a very good grade at her recent mock examination. I would like to thank Asma for her guidance and support, and I highly recommend her as a tutor.",

She tells me that you really explain things very well and she is now understanding science more. Keep up your dedication and hard work. Thank you, Asma. Asma has been brilliant. Danielle is doing very well in science. Excellent feedback from her teachers. Give Asma all the credit for her hard work and patience. I know you will help Danielle to achieve the best in her GCSE next year. Thank you.",

I joined Asma when I was not confident in maths and not getting good marks. Now, I have achieved a grade 9 in my GCSE maths and I will be taking A level maths. Iâ€™m so grateful for all the hard work and effort Asma put into each of our lessons. Thank you so much Asma!",
