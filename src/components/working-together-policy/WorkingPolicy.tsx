        Acemyexam – Our Working Together Policy
      </Heading>

      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        We are an Employment Business, as defined by law. The law sets out some rules and guidelines which we must follow.
      </Typography>

      <SubHeading variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        1. Information from a parent/client
      </SubHeading>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        To provide you with our best service and to comply with our obligations, we will get the following information from each parent/client (the person organising tuition for the student) before introducing them to tutors:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (1) Information about the parent/client and, if applicable (such as when we are working with a school), information about their organisation or business.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (2) The date that the parent/client would like the tutoring (we may also refer to this as the engagement or assignment) to start, and how long it will last (the duration or likely duration).
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (3) Information about the tutoring and what the parent/client requires, including experience, training or qualifications, where it will take place, the hours required, payment and any relevant expenses or benefits information (such as if a tutor is travelling), what notice is needed to end the tutoring, and, where relevant, any known health and safety risks (such as steep stairs for face-to-face tutoring venues).
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (4) Information about what experience, training, qualifications, and any authorisation that the parent/client considers necessary, or which are required by law or any professional body, to carry out that tutoring. Of course, there are some things that we will always have in place, such as working with children (vulnerable people).
      </Typography>

      <SubHeading variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        2. Information from a tutor
      </SubHeading>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        To provide you with our best service and to comply with our obligations, we will get the following information from each Tutor before introducing them to a parent/client:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (1) Confirmation of the tutor’s identity and right to work.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (2) Confirmation that the tutor considers they have the experience, training, qualifications, and any authorisation the parent/client considers necessary, or which is required by any professional body or by law to carry out the tutoring – this is usually in the form of a CV and teaching qualification.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (3) Confirmation that the tutor is willing to accept the tutoring, if offered.
      </Typography>

      <SubHeading variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        3. Tutor’s extra information
      </SubHeading>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (1) Where applicable, we will make sure that both a tutor and parents/clients are aware of any legal requirements relating to the tutoring.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (2) In particular, since most of the tutoring we offer requires references and/or professional qualifications and involves working with children (vulnerable people), we will take reasonable steps and offer to provide parents/clients with the following extra information about a tutor:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (a) Copies of any relevant qualifications and DBS and/or other relevant authorisations (including DBS and/or other relevant certificates) required, and/or
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (b) Two references from people unrelated to the tutor who have agreed that their references can be disclosed both to the tutor and relevant parents/clients.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (3) If we are unable to provide the extra information, then we let parents/clients know.
      </Typography>

      <SubHeading variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        4. Information about unsuitability of a tutor
      </SubHeading>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (1) Safeguarding is important to us.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (2) If we receive any information that, in our opinion, gives reasonable grounds (a realistic degree of certainty) to believe that any tutor working with a parent/client is or may be unsuitable for that tutoring, we will:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (a) Let the parent/client know as soon as is possible (usually on the same day or on the next business day where that is not reasonably practicable), and
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (b) Carry out reasonable enquiries and let the parent/client know the results of those enquiries in so far as the law will allow.
      </Typography>

      <SubHeading variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        5. Choosing the right tutor
      </SubHeading>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (1) We provide each tutor’s information on a confidential basis.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (2) Choosing the right tutor for a child is important, and we carefully consider the parent/client’s requirements and a tutor’s skills, experience, training, qualifications, and any relevant authorisation. Please also see section 2(2).
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (3) Based on information that is available to us at the relevant time, we will not introduce a tutor to a parent/client unless we:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (a) Feel that either the parent/client’s or tutor’s requirements for the tutoring are met, and
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (b) Consider that it would not be detrimental to the interests of either the parent/client or the tutor if the tutoring took place, and
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (c) Have not received any information that, in our opinion, gives reasonable grounds (a realistic degree of certainty) to believe a tutor is unsuitable for the tutoring, and
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (d) Have taken reasonable steps to consider any professional body requirements required for the tutoring and informed both the parent/client and tutor to be introduced about these.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (4) We use the information that we have obtained from the parent/client (see section 1) to make sure that the tutor has the information they require so that they can freely agree (consent) to do the tutoring, if offered. We always ask the tutor to confirm their agreement to do the tutoring.
      </Typography>

      <SubHeading variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        6. How we work
      </SubHeading>

        (c) We have a Safeguarding Policy which is available from contact@acemyexam.co.uk.

      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (a) Prevent them from ending their agreement with us, OR
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>

      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        (c) Mean that a tutor must let us (or anyone connected with us) know the identity of any future employer.
